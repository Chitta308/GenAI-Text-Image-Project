# GenAI-Text-Image-Project
This project leverages Generative AI to convert textual descriptions into corresponding images. By utilizing advanced deep learning techniques, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or transformer-based models like DALLÂ·E, the project enables the creation of realistic or imaginative images based on user-provided text prompts.
